# Diamond-Project
The purpose of this analysis is to answer the following questions using the Diamond Dataset:<br>
- Can a diamond's price be predicted by approximating its volume in milimeters?
- Can a combination of the Depth, Table, and Length/Width Ratio be used to classify a diamond's cut?

## The project contains the following files:
- [Diamonds.csv Dataset](https://github.com/DataBaeDev/Diamond-Project/blob/main/diamonds.csv)
- [Diamond Analysis Python Notebook](https://github.com/DataBaeDev/Diamond-Project/blob/main/Diamond_Analysis.ipynb)
     - EDA, Data Cleaning, Visualizations, Model Selection and Training
- [Diamond Machine Learning Testing](https://github.com/DataBaeDev/Diamond-Project/blob/main/Diamond_Machine_Learning_Testing.ipynb)
    - Tests the Selected Models using randomly generated values
- The Final Models (.pkl files)
